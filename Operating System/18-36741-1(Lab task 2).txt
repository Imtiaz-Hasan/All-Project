1. Write a script that will admit a student to CS course if the following condition is met. If it is not met than a message 'not admitted will be displayed'.
'Grade in Chemistry in A or grade in Physics is A or age is 18'

**********1********

#!/bin/bash
echo "Grade in Physics"
read physics
echo "Grade in Chemistry"
read chemistry
echo "Age"
read age
if [ $physics = "A" -o $chemistry = "A" -o $age == 18 ]
then
echo "Admit"
else
echo "not admitted"
fi

2. Use a loop to print the odd numbers between 0 and N. N will be a user input.

*******2*******

#!/bin/bash
read -p 'Enter the last number : ' n
a=0
while [ $a -lt n ]
do
	rem=$(( $a % 2))
	if [ $rem -ne 0 ]
	then
	echo $a
	fi
	a=$(( $a + 1 ))
done

3. A system will allow user to withdraw a specific amount if the following conditions are met
a. The withdraw amount is less than the available balance
b. After withdraw the available balance must be greater than or equal to 500

********3*******

#! /bin/bash
echo "Enter you balance : "
read balance
echo "Enter the amount you want to withdraw : "
read withdraw
current=`expr $balance - $withdraw`
if [ $balance -gt $withdraw ]
then
    if [ $current -ge 500 ]
    then 
        echo "Withdraw successfull."
        else
        echo "You have to keep at least 500tk in your balance"
    fi
else   
echo "Insufficient Balance!"
fi

4. Write a script that will ask the user to input numbers obtained for Physics, Chemistry, Maths
and English. Using these marks the system will show the equivalent grades using the
following grading policy80 or above - A
 70 to 79 - B
 60 to 69 - C
 50 to 59 - D
 Below 50 - F

#!/bin/bash
echo "Physics Marks: "
read marks
if [ $marks -ge 80 ]
then
echo "A"

elif [ $marks -ge 70 ]
then
echo "B"

elif [ $marks -ge 60 ]
then
echo "C"

elif [ $marks -ge 50 ]
then
echo "D"

else
echo "F"
fi

echo "Chemistry Marks: "
read marks
if [ $marks -ge 80 ]
then
echo "A"

elif [ $marks -ge 70 ]
then
echo "B"

elif [ $marks -ge 60 ]
then
echo "C"

elif [ $marks -ge 50 ]
then
echo "D"

else
echo "F"
fi

echo "English Marks: "
read marks
if [ $marks -ge 80 ]
then
echo "A"

elif [ $marks -ge 70 ]
then
echo "B"

elif [ $marks -ge 60 ]
then
echo "C"

elif [ $marks -ge 50 ]
then
echo "D"

else
echo "F"
fi

echo "Math Marks: "
read marks
if [ $marks -ge 80 ]
then
echo "A"

elif [ $marks -ge 70 ]
then
echo "B"

elif [ $marks -ge 60 ]
then
echo "C"

elif [ $marks -ge 50 ]
then
echo "D"

else
